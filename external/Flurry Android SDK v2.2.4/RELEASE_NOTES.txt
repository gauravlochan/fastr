Release notes for v2.1:
------------------------------------------------
<Offer API>
The process of accepting an Offer is significantly easier. Instead of processing a raw URL, the 
developer merely has to pass an offer ID to the SDK which automatically handles the process of
communicating with Flurry servers and launching the Android Market page for the recommended
application.

In addition to the Offer ID, the price and description of the app are also available.   

Rather than retrieving one random Offer, developers will have access to all the Offers that is 
available in the SDK at that time.

<Banner>
The SDK now backfills banners if they are displayed while ads are in the process of downloading.  
The ads will automatically be placed in the banner when they are available.

<Catalog>
The showCatalog() previously would not launch if there are no ads available (e.g. if there was a 
lack of network connectivity) without feedback to the user. It will now launch with the message 
"No recommendations available".

There is support for customizing the Intent name for launching the catalog. Previously a user 
opening a catalog would be forced to choose from a list of applications integrated with Flurry 
AppCircle due to these applications sharing the same Intent name for launching the catalog.  

<Availability of Ads>
There is now a simple method, hasAds(), to determine whether the SDK can supply any ads to 
be displayed. The new AppCircleCallback interface also allows the developer to determine the 
moment when new ads have been downloaded and are available.

<Android Market>
Some devices sold by certain carriers or in some countries do not include the Android Market app. 
The SDK will now check for this condition and launches the web version of the Android Market if 
the app is not available.

<New Callback Interface>
The developer can implement the new AppCircleCallback interface to receive AppCircle-type events.
These events are 
- ads have been downloaded from the network
- ads have been loaded from cache
- there is an error when launching the Android Market app

<STRICTMODE>
Google introduced a set of tests to check for conditions detrimental to user experience. Previous
versions of the SDK violated one of these tests -- writing and reading from the file system using 
the UI thread. This version passes all the tests.

<Bug fixes>
- the logEvent(String eventId, boolean timed) for timed events no longer ignores the "timed" 
  parameter
- the gender constants are now of byte type to match the setGender(byte gender) method
