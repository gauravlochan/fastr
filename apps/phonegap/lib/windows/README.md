Requires
---

- Windows Phone SDK 7.1 [http://create.msdn.com/en-us/home/getting_started]


Getting Started (Hey, not too rough)
---

- copy the file GapAppStarter.zip to the folder : \My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Templates\ProjectTemplates\
- Launch Visual Studio 2010 and select to create a new project
-- GapAppStarter should be listed as an option, give it a name
-- If you do not see it, you may have to select the top level 'Visual C#' to see it
- Build and Run it!

-- Also, if you prefer, you may add the project instead to the "Silverlight for Windows Phone" subfolder of "Visual C#".  This is up to you, and only affects where the GapAppStarter template is shown when creating a new project.

Note!!!
---

When you add or remove files/folders in the www folder you will need to do the following

- ensure the new item is included in the project ( Content ) This includes ALL images/css/html/js/* and anything that you want available at runtime.
-- Do not modify the GapSourceDictionary.xml file which is included in the project, it is auto-generated for you when you build.
